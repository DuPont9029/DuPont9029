        <div class="slide-title">MUSICPLAYER</div>
        <div class="slide-text">this was my very first project, at school we had just started learning html and css and so i wanted to try and create a site that would play music for unsuspecting visitors. the site had an audio tag with an autoplay, meaning that as soon as the site was visited the audio was played. unfortunately this method later stopped working and so i had to change the code to make it work. later when the method i was using was banned i converted the site to a handy music player, use it now!</div>

        <div class="slide-title">EQU2GRA</div>
        <div class="slide-text">ahh finally a project that sat close to my heart, especially since I started learning and using javascript from that project. there i learned how the input of values on a page worked, the calculations and conversions needed to perform a quadratic equation. because of the proximity to this project, the site underwent huge improvements afterwards. i introduced parsing of non-integer numbers, drawing of points on the line, and copying of results, use it now! </div>

        <div class="slide-text">now we move on to my first approach to http requests, I needed a site that would take my number of commits from github and compare it with those of my friends, as soon as I had the idea and learnt the how, making the site was a piece of cake. </div>

        <div class="slide-title">OPENSOLVER</div>
        <div class="slide-text">this is a tribute to the monero community of which i am a member, a very strong and united community in the battle against all economic oppression, which leverages state-of-the-art technologies (including blockchain) to achieve the goal that every cryptocurrency to date has failed to achieve. this site resolves openalias (which are strings in dns records) into the much longer monero addresses</div>

        <div class="slide-title">USERBOT</div>
        <div class="slide-text">this project wasn't supposed to be like this. initially i was trying to create a telegram bot that once it received an /input from the chat would return a pre-graded reply. apparently to do this i would need to use node, so i converted the site to one that just checks for messages from a bot that you already have, plus i learnt about parsing json documents.</div>

        <div class="slide-title">svGG</div>
        <div class="slide-text">this project of mine is due to an anger that one of my images had become corrupted. to remedy this i developed this site that converts images of all kinds into svg, a format where the image structure is defined by mathematical formulas. this ensures that there is no loss of quality in the image.</div>

        <div class="slide-title">YourAnimeList</div>
        <div class="slide-text">this project was born out of the fact that during a moment of boredom I was thinking about when myanimelist was hit by a hacker attack and was subsequently taken offline. so I created a backup tool to be able to read a backup of myanimelist even during a site blackout</div>
